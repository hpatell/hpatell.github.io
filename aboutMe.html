        During my free time, I enjoy playing basketball, hitting the gym, playing video games and hanging out with friends. 
        I also love to travel and do crazy adventureous things. One interesting fact about me is I like spicy food and that I 
        easily completed the Paqui Carolina Reaper One Chip Challenge without drinking or eating anything for 30 minutes.
